## Author:Tasleem Muzaffar


#### Description

Additional information about the variables, data and transformations used in the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

#### List of Variables

- aL = activity labels
- fr = features
- frw = features wanted
- mst = measurements
- tr = training data
- trAct = training activities
- trSub = training Subjects
- tst = test data set
- tstAct = test activities
- tstSub = test Subjects
- tot = combined test and train data set
 
# Goal of the Project
- A tidy data set
- A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
- A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how  they are connected.
 - Analysis R Script
